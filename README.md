# PersonalFinanceManagement
Personal Finance Management is a project which gives the user a set of activities he can perform on his financial data for the purpose of getting a clear picture of the incomes/expenses trends, as well as an option tp manage monthly budget and personal financial goals using different categories and subcategories.

For this project I used a layered architecture approach (Four tier). Which consists of the following layers:
 Presentation layer - It contains all categories related to the presentation layer.
 Business layer - It contains business logic.
 Persistence layer - Itâ€™s used for handling functions like object-relational mapping.
 Database layer - This is where all the data is stored

The firs functionality was importing the transactions and categories from CSV files, for which i used the CSVHelper library

Added minimal Front-End using angular, which lists all the transactions, and enables categorization of a single transaction
